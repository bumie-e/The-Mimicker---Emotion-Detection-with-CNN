# The-Mimicker Emotion Detection with CNN

## Objectives

- To build a system that mimicks body movements. We'll start with face then move to full body
- To deploy thismodel on a  mobile app

### Project Completion
50%. A dummy test model for detecting emotions has been built. 

## How to Use

### Dataset

Images used were webscrapped from Google with beautiful Soup. [Here's a good blog to guide.](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-scraping-with-python-a96feda8af2d)

200 Images for each of the 7 classes (angry, sad, happy, neutral, etc) 
Emoji images representing each of the classes we're downloaded to serve as a mimicker
